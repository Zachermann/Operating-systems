# Operating-systems
Repository for Operating systems class.
This contains the code I made and screenshots of it running inside the virtual machine.
When working on this project I had some trouble trying to get this code to compile in the virtual machine for a little bit.

update to the repository to include the code for homework 2
files included are the code for the homework and screenshots of it compiling 
The trouble I had when working on this project aside from getting it to compile was trying to get the program to print out the result properly. Along with that I felt this assignment gave me more insight into how memory is managed and the procedures taken to prevent deadlock.
